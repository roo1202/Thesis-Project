He knows he cannot survive much longer without them. He is also driven by a flicker of hope that the forest might offer a safer and more sustainable environment than the exposed beach.

His past experiences with anxiety amplify his feelings of helplessness.\n  \u00b7 Evento : \u0027Despertar con Esperanza\u0027 Motivaci\u00f3n: Lucas is primarily motivated by a cautious optimism. The rainwater has slightly improved his physical state, giving him a renewed, though fragile, sense of hope.

He remembers the tools and supplies that were lost in the shipwreck and hopes to recover something that can make his life easier. He also seeks a sense of closure, a way to connect with his past and the life he lost. The potential for finding something useful outweighs his fear of the open beach.\n  \u00b7 Evento : \u0027Un Coco Ca\u00eddo\u0027 Motivaci\u00f3n: Lucas is driven by a desperate need for sustenance and hydration. He knows that the coconut could provide him with vital nutrients and energy, potentially alleviating his hunger and weakness.

He is motivated by a desire to leave a record of his existence and to prevent others from suffering the same fate. He hopes that his message will provide valuable information to future castaways, helping them to survive and potentially escape the island.
